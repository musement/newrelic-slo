### Prerequisites

- docker
- docker-compose
- GNU make

```

For Mac users
You can get make with the latest version of Xcode (with [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)), available from Apple's [Mac Dev Center](http://developer.apple.com/mac/).

### Installing

#### Docker


__Note__:
before being able to run NR1 you will need to set the New Relic API Key in both:
- .env
- devcontainer.env

There are 2 ways to install the current project

- with Visual Studio Code

From the root of the project launch
```shell
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>
code .
```

It should automatically propose you to build and run the project into a container.
If not just follow the steps indicated on Microsoft's [offical documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

Then open the terminal of the container and run
```shell
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>
make prepare
```

- without Visual Studio Code

From the root of the project
```shell
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>
cd .devcontainer
docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate
make prepare
```

- commands

You can create a new package by giving a name as an environment variable
```shell
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>
PROJECT_NAME=my-awesome-nerdpack make create
```

Then you can try it by running the serve command (remembering to declare it as an environment variable)
```shell
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>
 PROJECT_NAME=my-awesome-nerdpack make run
docker exec -it qa-newrelic-slo bash -c 'cd my-awesome-nerdpack && nr1 nerdpack:serve'
